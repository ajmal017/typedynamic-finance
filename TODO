   b. Maximum drawdown
   c. Volatility, standard deviation
2. Implement scanner that given a portfolio of assets, identifies the one with the greatest volume deviation from historical norms. 
3. Event Risk analyzer: Given a specified recurring calendar event, calculate effects on returns, volume, and volatility. Construct a time series based on that recurring event. 
   a. Parse calendar schedule of a recurring event(s)
   b. Specify time series window: from time of event to next occurrence or n-day window
   c. Construct time series
   d. Calculate properties of time series 
   e. Coordinate document release scheduling and parsing
4. Quote Monitor or just Portfolio Monitor. This would entail a WebSocket interface.
